# This project is for my ISQA 3900 class. The shows that I have skills in HTML and CSS to develop a webpage. 

# This webpage covers the game Player Unknown's Battlegrounds.

# The game is a hunter games type game where everyone starts off with nothing and you collect items through the match and
# fight other players until you (if your playing by yourself) or your team is that last team alive.
