	Battlegrounds is a third-person shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royal,
 a type of large-scale deathmatch where players fight to be the last alive. Players can choose between free-for-all 
servers, or servers which allow small teams to participate. In either case, the last person or team left alive wins the match.
Each match starts with players parachuting onto an island from a plane without any items. Once they land, players can 
search buildings and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, and other equipment, which are randomly distributed 
throughout the map at the start of a match. Players then proceed to either stay hidden to avoid being killed or hunt 
down other players whilst continuing to search for more gear. Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well.
Every few minutes (starting at 5 minutes and then decreasing on subsequent cycles), the playable "safe" area of the map 
begins to shrink down towards a random location, with any player caught outside the safe area taking damage over time 
and eventually being eliminated; in game, the players see this as a shimmering blue wall that contracts over time.[3] 
This forces players into more confined areas and increases the chance of encounters with the surviving players. During 
the course of the match, random regions of the map are bombed, posing a threat to players that remain in that area.[4]
In both cases, players are warned a few minutes before these events, giving them time to relocate to safety. On average, 
a full round takes no more than 30 minutes.[5] At the completion of each round, players gain in-game currency based on
how long they survived, and how many other players they damaged or killed. The currency is used for purchasing cosmetic 
items for their character.
