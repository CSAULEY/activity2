<section class="information" id="s1">

The Med Kit is an important item to have in your survival stock. With Med Kits, you can dramatically extend your survivability and your ability to withstand more firefights. That being said, don't depend on them, as you're essentially locked in place for a time as the medkit is applied, which can make you a sitting duck. Unlike the First Aid Kit the Med Kit will immediately set the player's health to 100%.
