<section class="information" id="s7">

Suppressors are an attachment that packs baffles into a metal tube, causing expanding gas to be absorbed into the baffles, muffling sound from the expanding gases inside the muzzle. This has the result of reducing the "crack" sound of a bullet. While pop culture would have you believe this "silences" the sound, it really only suppresses the sound, and the actual effect of the suppressor is much more important - by muffling the sound and causing the soundwaves to disperse in other directions, it becomes much harder to pinpoint where the shot was fired.
